### Testing Permissions

For adding in scenarios, look in the Tests folder > permissions > scenarios_logic_test.go


### Add to list permissions
Only seen issues with too restrictive, not situations where permissions were not granted and the user could perform actions they dont have access to.

Usually as a result of: ResourceID: platformID

1. View all pipelines in Access Group [FIXED]
2. Edit all pipelines in Access Group - could edit pipeline, could run pipelne, not edit code
    - 
    * getNode
    * getSingleRemoteProcessGroup
3. Run should not be able to edit or save code changes
4. Edit a pipeline name needs access to list of process groups.
