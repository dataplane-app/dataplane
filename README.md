# Dataplane
Dataplane is the super fast, cloud native, scalable, secure and easy to use data platform for data-driven businesses. 

# Development
We setup a containerised environment in VS code using docker-compose. The idea is to have a simple setup that could simulate a Containerised/Kubernetes setup for basic development in either Mac, Windows or Linux dev environment. 

To run follow these steps
1. Install Remote Development in VS Code - extension id: ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
2. Click on the green section with two chevrons bottom left corner of VS code "Open a remote window"
3. Ensure Docker is running
4. Click on "Reopen in Container" 
5. To work outside of the container, click on the green section again and select "Reopen Folder Locally"
