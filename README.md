# Quick start
Once running, visit the dashboard at http://localhost:9000/webapp/<br /><br />
First time setup: http://localhost:9000/webapp/get-started

# Development
We setup a containerised environment in VS code using docker-compose. The idea is to have a simple setup that could simulate a Containerised/Kubernetes setup for basic development in either Mac, Windows or Linux dev environment. 

To run follow these steps
1. Install Remote Development in VS Code - extension id: ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
2. Click on the green section with two chevrons bottom left corner of VS code "Open a remote window"
3. Ensure Docker is running
4. Click on "Reopen in Container" 
5. To work outside of the container, click on the green section again and select "Reopen Folder Locally"

The license was chosen to discourage cloud providers offering this project as a data platform service. If you would like to offer Dataplane as a service, we are open to the conversation, come speak to us. For the rest of you (99.999%) who are using the software for your own personal or business needs, you can use the software freely where these restrictions will not apply. 

Thanks to Vectorized (https://vectorized.io/blog/open-source/), CockroachDB and Mariadb for researching and developing the Business Source License. We share the same views to strike a balance between making software open to the community while being protected from unfair practices that aim to commercially benefit without giving back to the community.
